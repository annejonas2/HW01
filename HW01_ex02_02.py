# Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# delimiter = '.'
# 
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression 
# and the type (of the value of the expression).

# 1. width/2
# value: 8	
# type: integer

# 2. width/2.0
# value: 8.5
# type: floating-point

# 3. height/3
# value: 4.0
# type: floating point

# 4. 1 + 2 * 5
# value: 11
# type: integer

# 5. delimiter * 5
# value:.....
# type: string

# I was surprised that height/3 was 4.0 rather than 4 - even though the height was a floating point I expected that in the result it would give an integer.
